Cooking a pot of pasta is one of the best kitchen skills you can learn. Pasta is inexpensive, cooks up quickly, and there are many ways to serve it, so if you don't know what to make for dinner, boil a pot of noodles! While they're cooking, check your pantry or refrigerator for pesto, sauce, or vegetables you can toss in. Within half an hour, you can have a homecooked pasta dinner on the table.
